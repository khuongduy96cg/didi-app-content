> **noun** (noun): a word (except a pronoun) that identifies a person, place or thing, or names one of them (proper noun)

The simple definition is: **a person, place or thing**. Here are some examples:

- person: man, woman, teacher, John, Mary
- place: home, office, town, countryside, America
- thing: table, car, banana, money, music, love, dog, monkey

    Note that any of the above can also be referred to by a pronoun. And note that names like John or America are called "proper nouns".

The problem with the simple definition above is that it does not explain why "love" is a noun but can also be a verb.

Another (more complicated) way of recognizing a noun is by its:

1. **ending**
2. **position**
3. **function**

# 1. Noun ending

There are certain word endings that show that a word is a noun, for example:

- -ity â†’ **nationality**
- -ment â†’ **appointment**
- -ness â†’ **happiness**
- -ation â†’ **relation**
- -hood â†’ **childhood**

But this is not true for the word endings of all nouns. For example, the noun "spoonful" ends in -ful, but the adjective "careful" also ends in -ful.

# 2. Position in sentence

We can often recognise a noun by its position in the sentence.

Nouns often come after a determiner (a determiner is a word like a, an, the, this, my, such):

- a **relief**
- an **afternoon**
- the **doctor**
- this **word**
- my **house**
- such **stupidity**

Nouns often come after one or more adjectives:

- a great **relief**
- a peaceful **afternoon**
- the tall, Indian **doctor**
- this difficult **word**
- my brown and white **house**
- such crass **stupidity**

# 3. Function in a sentence

Nouns have certain functions (jobs) in a sentence, for example:

- subject of verb: **Doctors** work hard.
- object of verb: He likes **coffee**.
- subject and object of verb: **Teachers** teach **students**.

But the subject or object of a sentence is not always a noun. It could be a pronoun or a phrase. In the sentence "My doctor works hard", the noun is "doctor" but the subject is "My doctor".
