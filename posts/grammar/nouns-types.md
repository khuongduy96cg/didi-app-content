Nouns are an important part of speech in English, probably second only to verbs. It is difficult to say much without using a noun.

There are several different types of English nouns. It is often useful to recognize what type a noun is because different types sometimes have different rules. This helps you to use them correctly.

### Common Nouns and Proper Nouns

#### Common Nouns

Most nouns are [common nouns](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-common.php). Common nouns refer to people, places and things in general like chair or dog. Any noun that is not a name is a common noun.

Examples: teacher, car, music, danger, receipt

- Have you seen my **dog**?
- The **books** are on your **desk**.
- ...the **pursuit** of **happiness**.

#### Proper Nouns

Names of people, places or organizations are [proper nouns](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-proper.php). Your name is a proper noun. *London* is a proper noun. *United Nations* is a proper noun.

Rule: Proper nouns always start with a capital letter.

Examples: *Jane, Thailand, Sunday, James Bond, Einstein, Superman, Game of Thrones, Shakespeare*

- Let me introduce you to **Mary**.
- The capital of **Italy** is **Rome**.
- He is the chairman of the **British Broadcasting Corporation**.
- I was born in **November**.

Note: Adjectives that we make from proper nouns also usually start with a capital letter, for example Shakespearian, Orwellian.

### Concrete Nouns and Abstract Nouns

#### Concrete Nouns

[Concrete nouns](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-concrete.php) are physical things that you can touch or otherwise sense.

Examples: *man, rice, head, car, furniture, mobile phone*

- How many **stars** are there in the **universe**?
- Have you met **James Bond**?
- Pour the **water** down the **drain**.

#### Abstract Nouns

[Abstract nouns](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-abstract.php) are the opposite of concrete nouns. They are things that you cannot touch. Abstract nouns are ideas, concepts and feelings.

Examples: *happiness, courage, danger, truth*

- He has great **strength**.
- Who killed President Kennedy is a real **mystery**.
- Sometimes it takes **courage** to tell the **truth**.
- Their lives were full of **sadness**.

### Countable Nouns and Uncountable Nouns

#### Countable Nouns 

(also called **count nouns**)

You can count countable nouns. Countable nouns have singular and plural forms.

Examples: *ball, boy, cat, person*

- I have only five **dollars**.
- The Earth was formed 4.6 billion **years** ago.
- There are lots of **people** but we don't have a **car**.

#### Uncountable Nouns

(also called **mass nouns**)

You cannot count uncountable nouns. You need to use "[measure words](https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/nouns-uncountable-measure-words.php)" to quantify them.

Rule: We never use uncountable nouns with the indefinite article (a/an). Uncountable nouns are always singular.

Examples: *water, happiness, cheese*

- Have you got some **money**?
- Air-conditioners use a lot of **electricity**.
- Do you have any **work** for me to do?
- Many Asians eat **rice**.

### Collective Nouns

A collective noun denotes a group of individuals.

Examples: *class* (group of students), *pride* (group of lions), *crew* (group of sailors)

Rule: Collective nouns can be treated as singular or plural. More about this at [rules of subject-verb agreement with collective nouns](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/subject-verb-agreement-collective-nouns.php).

- His *family* live in different countries.
- An average *family* consists of four people.
- The new *company* is the result of a merger.
- The *board of directors* will meet tomorrow.

### Compound Nouns

A compound noun is a noun that is made with two or more words. Most compound nouns are [noun + noun] or [adjective + noun]. Each compound noun acts as a single unit and can be modified by adjectives and other nouns.

Compound nouns have three different forms:

- open or spaced - space between words (**bus stop**)
- hyphenated - hyphen between words (**mother-in-law**)
- closed or solid - no space or hyphen between words (**football**)

Examples: *cat food, blackboard, breakfast, full moon, washing machine, software*

- Can we use the **swimming pool**?
- They stop work at **sunset**.
- Don't forget that **check-out** is at 12 noon.

Note that all nouns are more than one type. For example, **common nouns** can be **concrete nouns** or **abstract nouns**. (The **common noun** *danger* is an **abstract noun**.)

And the same noun can change its type according to meaning. For example, the noun *light* can be **uncountable** (light in general) or **countable** (lamp).
