It's not easy to describe a noun. 
In simple terms, nouns are "things" (and verbs are "actions"). 
Like ***food***. Food (n) is something you eat (v). 
Or ***happiness***. Happiness (n) is something you want (v). 
Or ***human being***. A human being (n) is something you are (v).

These pages explain more about the grammar of nouns and offer example sentences, quizzes and songs.
